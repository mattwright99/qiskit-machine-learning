    Classification models (i.e. models that extend the ``NeuralNetworkClassifier`` class like VQC)
    can now handle categorical target data in methods like ``fit()`` and ``score()``. Categorical
    data is inferred from the presence of non-numerical data and is automatically encoded using
    either one-hot or integer engodings. Encoder type is determined by the ``one_hot`` argument
    supplied when instantiating the model.
